## What is FusionBrick?

FusionBrick is a **parametric modular design system** for 3D printing. It provides a set of interlocking pieces — called **Bricks** — that connect in any direction, on any face, without tools.

Inspired by the simplicity of LEGO and the precision of engineering, FusionBrick is designed for:

- ⚡ **Rapid prototyping** of electronics cases, structures and brackets
- 🔩 **Press-fit assembly** — no screws, no glue required
- 📐 **Parametric design** — every dimension is a variable
- 🌐 **Open source** — fork it, extend it, share it

---

## Core Concepts

FusionBrick is built around one rule:

> **Any piece connects to any other piece, on any face, in any direction.**

Every Brick has holes on all 6 faces following the same grid pattern. A **Link** (separate connector piece) joins any two holes together — press-fit for prototyping, glued for permanent builds.

## The Pieces

| Piece | Preview | Description | File |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| **ATOM** | <img src="renders/img/atom.gif" width="140" alt="ATOM"> | Cubic structural unit. Holes on all 6 faces. | `impl/openscad/atom.scad` |
| **PLATE** | <img src="renders/img/plate.gif" width="140" alt="PLATE"> | Flat modular surface. Grid-aligned holes. | `impl/openscad/plate.scad` |
| **LINK** | <img src="renders/img/link.gif" width="140" alt="LINK"> | Universal connector. Joins any two holes. | `impl/openscad/link.scad` |
| **BRIDGE** | <img src="renders/img/bridge.gif" width="140" alt="BRIDGE"> | Invisible coplanar joint between two PLATEs. | `impl/openscad/bridge.scad` |
| **CORNER** | <img src="renders/img/corner.gif" width="140" alt="CORNER"> | Corner beam. Joins two PLATEs at 90° via edge holes. | `impl/openscad/corner.scad` |

## System Parameters

All pieces share the same global parameters. **Keep them equal across pieces to guarantee compatibility.**

```
cell_size     = 20mm   // base grid unit
hole_d        = 10mm   // hole diameter
relief_depth  = 2mm    // countersink depth
relief_margin = 2mm    // countersink margin
tolerance     = 0.2mm  // print fit tolerance
canal_d       = 6mm    // wire channel in every connector (0 = solid)
```

System premises: [spec/design-system.md](spec/design-system.md) · Grid Law and joints: [spec/rules.md](spec/rules.md).

> **Compatibility rule:** if `cell_size`, `hole_d` and `relief_*` are equal across pieces, all holes align perfectly — no matter which pieces you combine.

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html) 2021+
- Any FDM printer (tested on Bambu Lab A1 Mini)
- PLA or PETG filament

### Print your first ATOM

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wguilherme/fusionbrick.git
```

2. Open in OpenSCAD
```bash
cd fusionbrick
open impl/openscad/atom.scad
```

3. Render and export STL
```
Press F6 to render → File → Export → Export as STL
```

4. Slice and print
   - Layer height: `0.2mm`
   - Infill: `20%+`
   - Supports: `No`

### Or use pre-exported STLs
Pre-built STL files are available in the `renders/stl/` folder.

## Implementations

FusionBrick follows a **spec-first** approach. The `spec/` folder defines the system contract — any CAD tool can implement it.

| Implementation | Status | Maintainer |
|---|---|---|
| OpenSCAD | ✅ Active | @wguilherme |
| Fusion 360 | 🔜 Planned | — |
| FreeCAD | 🔜 Planned | — |
| MakerWorld PMM | 🔜 Planned | — |
